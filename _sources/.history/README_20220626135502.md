# Welcome
Welcome to the readme.md of the CDS Book. Currently, this contains the plan for the project. However, I will write some short instructions on how to add pages etc and set up an enviroment such that one can contributre to the book easily. 

## Standards for the book
Code cell line width: 75 Characters
###
Writing style: 
- Exclusively in 3rd person.
- Formal
### Matplotlib Defaults:
- Colours:
    - [x] Dur_utils module that contains colours.
    - [ ] Decide on a gradient colour scheme for 3d/many line plots
- Consistent Figure sizes (10,6) for single depth Page Wide Plots
- Consistent Font size/style for figures and text 
- Consistent tick spacing 
    - [ ] Edit RCparams
- Make an environment.yml file that has packages and changes to matplolib 
    - [ ] .yml


## Plan 
### Landing Page
- [ ] Gallery of best visualisations
#### Chapter 1:
- Global $\textrm{CO}_2$: Question Can we identify Global CO_2 change because of Pandemic 

Pages:
- [x] Data Exploration
- [x] Curve fitting
- [x] Hypothesis Testing 
- [x] Conclusion And Questions
Formating:
- [x] Hide Code Cells
- [x] Standardise
- [x] Inital Proof
#### Chapter 2
- Global Temperature rise, Predictive modelling. 
- [ ] Discuss the limited scope of curve fitting. Explore the error quantification.
    - [x] Page one and solution to the previous question
    - [x] Discussion section on the results.

Pages:
- [ ] G 
- [ ] Figure out how to use the Berkly Earth Data that is formatted weirdly.

Formating:
- [ ] Hide Code Cells
- [ ] Standardise
- [ ] Initial Proof
#### Chapter 3
- Radiation Modeling: Building Packages, Large Datasets 
- [ ] refactoring the code from last year.
