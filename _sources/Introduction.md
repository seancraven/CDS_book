# Introduction 
This book intends to provide a pedagogical guide to radiation modelling for an undergraduate. It follows the work completed in the summer of 2021 by Sean Craven. Initially, a set of Jupyter notebooks were produced inspired by the plots of Dr Robert Rode {cite}`rhodetweet2019` using the PyRads package {cite}`PyRads`.

The notebooks and accompanying files; were developed as a less comprehensive alternative to PyRads. The aim for the future reader is that the continuation of the project would be more easily facilitated with a comprehensive guide. The initial project provided a steep learning curve for the author. Hopefully, with this book's help, the reader can develop their Python skills, learn about climate change mechanisms, and feel motivated to help make a change. With a slightly softened learning process. Hopefully, the state of this repository and book can be improved by future students. The basic framework of the book should form a foundation for future projects. Further chapters can be added at the end of internships, with code building off the GitHub repository.

 Development of readable maintainable code is not something often taught in an undergraduate Physics course. However, when working with others or on long projects, the veracity of 'Code is read more than it is written'-Guido Van Rossum becomes evident. Becuase of this, the author would recommend that you are accustomed to PEP-8 and PEP-484. In addition, the Google Python Style guide has some very prudent suggestions worth reading. This, in conjunction with good naming practices and reasonable amounts of comments, makes deciphering code a feasible task. Such practices outlined in these documents will help the reader and future contributors collaborate and maintain this and other work.

The initial author hopes that their original body of work is easily accessible and can be built off with relative ease and that his effort in making a framework for continuation bears fruit.
