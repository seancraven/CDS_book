    "# Radiation Modelling\n",
    "\n",
    "This section of the book differs from the previous section as it follows a longer form example in building a model of radiation absorption. Often treatment of the greenhouse effect is incredibly simple and uses Sankey diagrams, which illustrate well the effect that increased radiation retention produces warming. However, they lack any information on the mechanisms taking place. Unfortunately, these phenomena are highly interdependant. This interdependency does not lend them to simple models. However, this section is hopefully easily parsable. "

    "## Absorption Spectra\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into atmospheric physics, we will look into absorption spectra, as absorption is one of the fundamental mechanisms that drive the greenhouse effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Molecular absorption, if you have met it in early quantum mechanics courses, is often described as a discrete phenomenon. However, this is not the case. Despite the mechanism for their occurrence being quantised. \n",
    "\n",
    "Line spectra arise from energy level transitions within atoms. For example, when photons of sufficient energy collide with a molecule a transition can occur. The coupling of the states to the EM-field governs the transition's probability. The different strength interactions provide differing intensities of line shapes. \n",
    "\n",
    "This section will not deal with photon molecule interactions as the photonic densities in systems like these are large enough that treating the coupling of atoms to a field is accurate enough and more straightforward. \n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "As an exercise, you may want to estimate the photon density per meter squared, given that the temperature of Earth is $\\approx 300K$.\n",

    "Spectral lines may not have a finite width due to the uncertainty principle. Excited states have a defined lifetime $ 2\\tau$, corresponding to the characteristic decay time for the excited state.

    "\n",
    "There is an additional component which increases the value of $\\tau$. Transitions induce the broadening from pressure due to collisions with other neighbouring molecules.

    "### The Voigt Profile\n",
    "\n",
    "Because these broadening effects do not change the amount of emitted light, their area must stay constant. Thus the combination of the profiles is a convolution of Lorentzian and Gaussian distribution functions.\n",
