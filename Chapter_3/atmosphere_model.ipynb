    "# Radiative Transfer Model\n",
    "Throughout the previous chapter, we have been laying the groundwork for building the final model. This page walks throught the important sections of the implementation in python. The code that is run in this section to generate the plots, uses the SimpleTrans package, however the snippets of code shown are intended as a conceptual walk through of how the program runs and how the solution is implemented rather than the exact code in the module as, this is likely to change."
